# Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN & Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based web application for detecting potato leaf diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model classifies potato leaves into three categories:
- **Healthy**
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**

The trained model is integrated into a **Streamlit** web application with an interactive dark-mode UI, image transformations, and prediction features.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for building and training the CNN model)
- **Streamlit** (for the web-based user interface)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization and evaluation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model evaluation metrics)

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of three categories of potato leaf images:
```
Dataset/
â”‚â”€â”€ Train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Early_blight/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_healthy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Late_blight/
â”‚â”€â”€ Valid/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Early_blight/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_healthy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Late_blight/
â”‚â”€â”€ Test/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Early_blight/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_healthy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Potato_Late_blight/
```

## Installation & Setup
### **1. Create a Virtual Environment**
```sh
python -m venv env
```
Activate the environment:
- **Windows**: `env\Scripts\activate`
- **Linux/Mac**: `source env/bin/activate`

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Train the Model** *(Only if needed)*
```sh
python train_model.py
```
This will train a CNN model and save it as `models/potato_leaf_cnn.h5`.

### **4. Run the Streamlit App**
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
